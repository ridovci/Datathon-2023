# BTK Akademi Datathon 2023
This GitHub repository contains the Shopping Customer Classification project developed for the 2023 BTK Datathon.

# Project Objectives
The main goal of this competition is to predict which classes customers of a shopping company belong to and to develop marketing strategies for these classes.

# Data Set
The dataset used in the project includes the following features:

* Gender
* Age Group
* Marital Status
* Education Level
* Employment Status
* Annual Average Income
* City of Residence
* Most Interested Product Group
* Annual Average Purchase Amount
* Annual Average Ordered Product Count
* Education Continuation Status
* Annual Average Products Added to Cart
* Cluster Name (the label to be predicted)

# Solution Approach

Throughout the project, the following steps were followed:

1. Exploratory data analysis
2. Relational data analysis
3. Clustering analysis
4. Determining the best model with machine learning algorithms
5. Feature engineering
6. Determining the best model with hyperparameter tuning
7. Performance testing with various metrics

The Random Forest algorithm was chosen due to its effectiveness in multi-class problems, good performance, fast learning, various hyperparameter options, resistance to overfitting, and automatic feature selection.

# Results
Even though my results were the same as the 1st place in the competition, I came 22nd in the rankings.
